                            Hello, I am Max! I am a 20 years old Bestie from the French region of Ardèche. It is one of the most sparsely populated place in mainland France and has twice as many goat than human inhabitants.
                            It is well known for its lost caves, abrupt cliffs and its maroon cream.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy exploring my homeland every spring and summer, there are just so many things to see: Mountain biking and cycling in the mountains, canoeing in the river's gorges, exploring abandoned quarries and old caves... 
                            I am passionate about discovery and exploration, whether it is next to my home or in a far away place!
                        </p>

                            But someday, I decided to look beyond my small town and goat friends, and went to the big city of Lyon. 
                            I am now entering fourth year at my university, INSA Lyon.
                            I am currently studying Computer Science (and thus I made this motivational letter in the form of a webpage, just for flexing).
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Overall, the people at Lyon are overwhelmingly friendly, and I'm having a great time partying and meeting new people.
                            As for the computer classes, well... Let's just say I am trying to hide the pain from online classes and boring lectures as much as I can!
                        </p>

                            I also wanted to get myself invested in sports when I joined my university. I was willing to join a famous and glorious sport, but instead, I picked ultimate frisbee...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered Ultimate when I arrived in Lyon, and became an absolute fan and joined my university team. It is not very common, I must concede, but I loved the friendly spirit of the game.
                            Now, I am trying to get as many of my friends to play Ultimate with... moderate success! 
                            Thus, if you're planning a friendly frisbee tournament at Istanbul, you can count me on!! (as well with any sports activity!)

                            Even though I come from one of the most remote places in France, I still had the chance to go a little abroad during my university time. I especially remember going for a one week trip in Spain in February 2020 with my language class, officially for a "video project" on a Spanish city. 
                            We thus choose to go to Malaga, in Southern Spain. Definitely for its culture and identity, and not because we made our trip in winter and the weather was always sunny with 25°C during that season. I had the chance to tour the city's most famous "city monuments" (child playgrounds) and "gastronomical heritage" (bars, tapas and bars again).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would be happy to discover restaurants and playgrounds at Istanbul this December, alongside its famous monuments, streets and landscapes!

                            As for languages, I speak fluently French, English and Spanish. I also took Chinese last year as a beginner at my university, as I was interested by Chinese culture and wanted to discover a new language structure. However, it is so hard to learn, and my level is still quite basic. Guess I wouldn't be able to read the menu in a Chinese restaurant for a least a few years!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the same subject, I can also not resist to share my last year Spanish project, where we had to record ourselves singing a parody of Despacito. (In 2020, yes.) The result is as cringe as you can expect.

                            I joined BEST Lyon at the beginning of last year, inspired by a friend. Times were tough as we struggled to organize meetings and events during lockdown, but the LBG managed to stand strong as a group. 
                            We were able to organize a local Spring Course for the international students at our school, for which I was the academic responsible. 
                            I also participated in trainings, regional meetings, alongside parties and, of course, a cantus! (interrupted at 4am by school security, thus technically still ongoing...)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was promoted to full member at the end of this school year, and I am still looking forward implicating myself more into LBG Lyon's events and organization!

                            it was my first international event with BEST! Even though I was sometimes a bit disconnected from the mood due to the online zooms, I still had a great time and was able to meet people from many LBGs during sessions and night events!

            And so here I am. I am very excited about SCARLET and I would definitely get the party rolling at Istanbul for new year's eve!
            I would really like to experience a festive event with BEST International, as the pandemic altered my BEST experience a little. There are so many people I would like to discover or meet again, and being at SCARLET this winter would be a wonderful experience!
