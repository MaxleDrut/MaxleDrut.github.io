                        Hello, I am Max! I am a 20 years old Bestie from the French region of Ardèche. It is one of the most sparsely populated place in mainland France and has twice as many goat than human inhabitants.
                        It is well known for its lost caves, abrupt cliffs and its maroon cream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But someday, I decided to look beyond my small town and goat friends, and went to the biggest city of Lyon. It was dense, scary, and they even had cars! But hopefully my first roommate's smell reminded me of the smell of my neighbour's farm. A small window of rural life in my apartment :)

                        I am now entering fourth year at my university in Lyon, France. My first step in a big city. 
                        I am currently studying Computer Science (and thus I made a webpage motivational letter, just for flexing). Overall, the people at Lyon are overwhelmingly friendly, and I'm having a great time partying and meeting new people.
                        As for the computer classes, well... Let's just say I am trying to hide the pain from online classes and boring lectures as much as I can!

                        I also wanted to get myself invested in sports when I joined my university. I was willing to join a true sport, but instead, I picked ultimate frisbee... <br/>
                        Just kidding, I discovered that sport when I arrived in Lyon, and became an absolute fan and joined my university time. Now, I am trying to get as many of my friends to play Ultimate with... moderate success! 
                        But if you're planning a friendly frisbee tournament at Istanbul, you can count me on!!

                        Even though I come from one of the most remote places in France, I still had the chance to go a little abroad during my university time. I especially remember going for a one week trip in Spain in February 2020 with my language class, officially for a "video project" on a Spanish city. 
                        We thus choose to go to Malaga, in Southern Spain. Definitely for its culture and identity, and not because we made our trip in winter and the weather was always sunny with 25°C during that season. I had the chance to tour the city's most famous "city monuments" (child playgrounds) and "gastronomical heritage" (bars, tapas and bars again).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would be happy to discover restaurants and playgrounds at Istanbul this December, alongside its famous monuments, streets and landscapes!

                        As for languages, I speak French, English and Spanish. I also took Chinese last year as a beginner at my university, language for which after 50 hours of teaching I can barely say hello and ask somebody's name...

                        On the same subject, I can also not resist to share my last year Spanish project, where we had to record ourselves singing a parody of Despacito. (In 2020, yes). The result is as cringe as you can expect:

                        I joined BEST Lyon at the beginning of last year, inspired by a friend. Times were tough as we struggled to organize meetings and events during lockdown, but the LBG managed to stand strong as a group. We were able to organize a local Spring Course for the international students of our school, as long as a cantus (interrupted at 4am by school security, thus technically still ongoing), trainings, meetings and parties!

                        I was also nominated as a delegate for my LBG during last year's GA, as it was my first international event with BEST! Even though I was sometimes a bit disconnected from the mood due to the online zooms, I still had a great time and was able to meet people from many LBGs during sessions and night events!

    <h2>Next step: Istanbul?</h2>
    <p style="margin: 20px;">
        And so here I am. I am very excited about SCARLET and I would definitely get the party rolling at Istanbul for New year's eve!
        I would really like to experience a festive event with BEST International, as the pandemic altered my BEST experience a little. There are so many people I would like to discover or meet again, and being at SCARLET this winter would be a wonderful experience!

        Thus, thank you very much for your reading, and I hope we will meet up soon at Istanbul! :)
